# Data_Lake_case
This is a Data Analysis case solved by me for a Cleaning Equipment Manufacturer company.

The company is one of the world's leading manufacturers of professional cleaning equipment.

The  Global Digital Marketing team aims to create a Data Lake using Google Cloud Platform, as a first step towards their ‘Single Source of Truth’ vision. 
The aim is to establishing a data infrastructure and creating a single place for shared knowledge.

Questions:
Which considerations and potential pitfalls must the project team on the Marketing Data Lake project be aware of?

You are to provide the leadership team with recommendations on visual design and relevant Marketing KPIs to report on an Executive Summary dashboard in Power BI.
